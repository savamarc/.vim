# `.vim`
This is my `.vim` and my `.vimrc`. It is very basic and I don't update them very
often. Also note that my vim is setup to work with the Solus Project version
that already contains a few non standard 'saner' defaults.

# Usage in case I ever need to reinstall this
These few lines should setup this `.vimrc` and download the vim plugins I use.

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:savamarc/.vim.git
